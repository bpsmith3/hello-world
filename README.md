# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi all,

My name is Brian Smith. I am currently a student at NCSU working towards a MR in Bioinformatics.
I have experience implementing algorithms related to bioinformatics in R and Python.
I will be graduating in May 2017 and hope to find work starting part time in spring 2017 semester.
